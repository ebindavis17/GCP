Execute one of these commands while you are logged into the virtual machine:
$sudo shutdown -h now
$sudo poweroff

To change the machine type of the running instance
#Stop the running instance -$11
$gcloud compute instances set-machine-type INSTANCE --machine-type MACHINE-TYPE
#A custom machine type with 4 vCPUs and 1 GB of memory can be specified as:
--machine-type custom-4-1024
