To list the instances running
$gcloud compute instances list

To list all the details about the instance
$gcloud compute instances describe “instance name”

To list the machine types 
$gcloud compute machine-types list

Use the instances stop command and specify one or more instances that you want to stop.
$gcloud compute instances stop example-instance-1 example-instance-2

To permanently delete the VM instance 
$gcloud compute instances delete example-instance

Optionally, you can stop an instance through the guest operating system using the sudo shutdown -h now or sudo poweroff commands. 
Execute one of these commands while you are logged into the virtual machine:
$sudo shutdown -h now
$sudo poweroff

To change the machine type of the running instance
#Stop the running instance -$11
$gcloud compute instances set-machine-type INSTANCE --machine-type MACHINE-TYPE
#A custom machine type with 4 vCPUs and 1 GB of memory can be specified as:
--machine-type custom-4-1024
